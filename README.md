## Description of Repository

This repository contains the reproducible R script used to generate all tables and figures presented in the paper:

**"The Impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on Online Tracking"**

The paper analyzes the effect of the GDPR on online tracking using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach and the Generalized Synthetic Control method. The code processes data from **WhoTracks.me** to reproduce the results.

## Data Sources

### Public Data:

The analysis relies on **WhoTracks.me** data, which is publicly available at:\
<https://github.com/whotracksme/whotracks.me>

### Proprietary Data:

Some datasets used in the paper (e.g., SimilarWeb) are proprietary and cannot be shared in this repository. Instead, we use a **filtered version** of the proprietary data that is necessary to produce the results reported in our paper. This ensures that the analysis is reproducible without compromising the confidentiality of the raw proprietary data.

## How to Instantly Replicate Analysis Using Posit Cloud

Use the prepared project on **Posit Cloud** to instantly replicate the analysis. Simply click on the link below to get started:

-   **GDPR Paper Analysis** on [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/project/%3Cproject-id%3E)

Once the project opens, follow the instructions in the `README.md` file inside the Posit Cloud environment to reproduce the analysis.

## Instructions to Replicate Analysis on Local Machine Using RStudio Desktop

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<repository-name>.git
    ```

2.  Open the R project in **RStudio Desktop**.

3.  Install the required packages if you have not already:

    ``` r
    install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "fixest", "flextable", "magick", "here", "readr", "data.table", "tidyr", "scales"))
    ```

4.  Run the script `reproducible_analysis.R` to reproduce all tables and figures as presented in the paper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reproducibility with `renv`

To ensure reproducibility, we use the **`renv` package** to snapshot the project environment and manage package versions. This allows anyone to recreate the exact environment used for the analysis.

### How to Use `renv`

1.  After cloning the repository, open the project in **RStudio Desktop**.

2.  Run the following command to restore the package environment:

    ```         
    renv::restore()
    ```

3.  This will install all necessary packages with their exact versions as used in the original analysis.

### Creating a New Snapshot

If you add or update packages, you can create a new snapshot of the environment by running:

```         
renv::snapshot()
```

This will update the `renv.lock` file with the current package versions.
