## Description of Repository

This repository contains the reproducible R script used to generate all tables and figures presented in the paper:

**"The Impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on Online Tracking"**

The paper analyzes the effect of the GDPR on online tracking using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach and the Generalized Synthetic Control method. The code processes data from **WhoTracks.me** to reproduce the results.

## Data Sources

### Public Data:

The analysis relies on **WhoTracks.me** data, which is publicly available at:\
<https://github.com/whotracksme/whotracks.me>

### Proprietary Data:

Some datasets used in the paper (e.g., SimilarWeb) are proprietary and cannot be shared in this repository. Instead, we use a **filtered version** of the proprietary data that is necessary to produce the results reported in our paper. This ensures that the analysis is reproducible without compromising the confidentiality of the raw proprietary data.
